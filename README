pynmsg
======

This is `pynmsg`, a Python extension module implemented in
[Cython](http://cython.org/) for the [nmsg](https://github.com/farsightsec/nmsg)
C library.

Building
--------

Building from a git checkout requires a C compiler, Python, Cython, and the
`nmsg` library to be installed first. Distribution tarballs ship with a copy of
the Cython-generated code and do not require Cython to actually be installed.

`pynmsg` is built by running `setup.py`:

    python setup.py build
